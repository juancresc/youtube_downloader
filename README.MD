## Youtube downloader

This script will create a very simple webpage where you can search for videos in youtube (youtube-search lib) and play / download them (youtube-dl) created with Flask.


## DISCLAIMER

This is not intended to be a tool to download unlicenced content, but rather an exercise to show how easy is to build apps using Flask and python libraries.
